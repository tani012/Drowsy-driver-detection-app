# Driver Drowsiness Detection System

## Project Overview

This project aims to enhance road safety by developing a face detection and alarm system to prevent drowsy driving among truck drivers. The system is integrated into an Android app for ease of use.

## Motivation

- Road accidents in India are primarily caused by driver faults.
- Annually, drowsy driving causes approximately 100,000 crashes, 1,500 fatalities, and 50,000 injuries in the U.S.
- Many truck drivers in India come from poor backgrounds, and their families suffer when they die in accidents caused by overwork.

## Problem Statement

Develop a face detection and alarm system to:
- Detect eye movements to predict drowsiness.
- Integrate the detection algorithm into an Android app for accessibility.

## Key Features

- **Improved Safety**: Reduces accidents by alerting drowsy drivers.
- **Regulatory Impact**: Supports the development of stricter regulations on driver rest periods and fatigue management.
- **Tech Integration**: Implements technology to detect drowsiness and prompt timely breaks.

## Technical Approach

- **Algorithm**: Detects eye movement to predict drowsiness.
- **App Integration**: The algorithm is integrated into an easy-to-use Android app.
- **Notification System**: Uses networking to notify drivers.
- **Efficiency**: Optimized for minimal RAM usage and battery conservation.
- **Alerts**: Provides effective alarm sounds to alert the driver.

## Implementation Details

1. **Data Collection**: Images and videos for training/testing.
2. **Algorithm Development**: Using Python, OpenCV, and TensorFlow.
3. **App Development**: Using Android Studio.
4. **Notification System**: Implemented via networking techniques.
5. **Testing**: Ensured accuracy and efficiency.

## Future Work

- Explore advanced architectures like ResNet.
- Test on larger datasets for comprehensive evaluation.
- Enhance real-time alerts and feedback mechanisms.
